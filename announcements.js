<h2>For Phase 2 Sem 4 Students</h2>
<p>Almost all summaries for HNS, locomotor and endocrine (except a few tutorial summaries) are done. I will work on the rest of the tutorials and the IM3 summaries shortly. I apologise for the long day.</p>
<p>For the HNS spotter, all summaries for all practicals are ready. Please pay attention to what I write in the notes/disclaimer area. You may use the summary as a core study material, but I highly recommend you check the links I post at least once. Some are mandatory.</p>
