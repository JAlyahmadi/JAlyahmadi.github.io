<h4 style='color: var(--primary); margin: 10px 0 -3px 0'>Note on Feedback:</h4>
<span style='text-align: justify; display:block'>In the feedback form, many students suggested adding real notifications for the changelog. I apologise that this is not possible for this website as there are limitations imposed by the way the website was created which prevent such a feature from being implemented. Also note that the changelogs is something that is only editable by 3 people in total due to it being user-unfriendly for our team of editors, plus I have retired from making summaries, so you will no longer see many updates to the changelog (only for website changes and important additions). Thank you for your feedback; I have implemented quite a few suggestions from there into the website, and I massively appreciate your support. I wish you the best of luck in the new semester.<br><span class='text-muted'>- Jihad Al-Yahmadi</span></span>
