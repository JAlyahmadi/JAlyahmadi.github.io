<h2>Message to Sem 4 Students Studying for HNS ICA</h2>
<p>If you are a phase 2 semester 4 student studying for the HNS ICA and you rely on my summaries, please note that I have uploaded a practical summary for HNS P03 (brainstem). When studying my L04 (brainstem) lecture summary for the ICA, I highly recommend you refer to my P03 practical summary as well, as I have labelled the histology images there according to the recording. I think it will help you quite a lot. Good luck :)</p>
