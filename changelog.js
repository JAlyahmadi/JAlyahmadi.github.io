Welcome back to the Golden Drive website, I hope you had an enjoyable winter break. This is a large website update. Here is the list of changes:
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Website load time:</b> Significant reduction in website load time on SQU campus by 87% (theoretical estimation; I will check for myself when I am back on campus).
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Changelogs unread count:</b> Changelogs now display the number of unread changes from outside (to motivate more people to check the changelogs more regularly in case there is something important).
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Announcements:</b> Added announcements that show up every time you load the website until you click "Do not show this again". This is what you are seeing right now. It will be used to make important announcements.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Website polish:</b> Slight adjustments to the colour scheme of the website and added fancier animations and loading animations, giving off a smoother-looking browsing experience. The logo is now clickable to navigate to the first page.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Themes:</b> You can now change the theme of the website to suit your taste (find them under "Theme" from the top bar), and added a light mode for those sick people who have no taste!
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Message of the Day:</b> Message of the day or MOTD is what shows up when the website is loading for you to read. It is a daily universal message that changes each day for everyone. It is like daily tips for things you can do on the website, but some of them are goofy.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Resources page:</b> A new page for resources. Books and Video Library can now be found here, along with other things (histology program, radiology images, SPSS, links to other batch drives). Please note that "Bacteriology Biochemicals" and "Virology Virus Properties" are empty for now; we will work on them as soon as we can.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Tips and Study Guides page:</b> A new page with various study-related guides. The old "Study Tips" has been removed in exchange for this. Please note that for now, only the first 3 guides are available. We will try to write the rest as soon as we can.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Bookmarks icon:</b> The bookmarks tab now display the icons of the pages that were bookmarked. This will make navigation even more convenient.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>Contact us page polish:</b> The contact us page has been more polished and editors for different batches are now grouped together for convenience. Old @golden-drive.net emails have been removed because they turned out to be inconvenient for us.
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>New books and a video library:</b> Added 4 new books (Tabers dictionary, the chemistry textbook, Zumdahl's chemistry textbook, and Robbins review of pathology) and a new video library (Picmonic).
<b style='color: var(--primary)'>More changes:</b> A lot of other minor changes were made, both to the website, and the drive on Google Drive.
