Added an alternative video library link at the top bar to bypass SQU's Internet issues.<ul><li>It was reported that mega.nz on which the video libraries linked on the Golden Drive are hosted (e.g., Pathoma, Sketchy, BnB) is inaccessible with SQU's Internet, so female students residing in SQU's dorms are unable to watch those videos. Until SQU's Internet is fixed on their end, I added an alternative link for the videos hosted on Google Drive to make the videos accessible again for such students. You can find the link at the top bar of this website ("Temporary Video Library Alternative"). This is a temporary emergency fix, so unexpected problems might occur. If you encounter any such problems, please report them to me.</li></ul>

<h4 style='color: var(--primary); margin: 10px 0 -3px 0'>Note on Feedback:</h4>
In the feedback form, many students suggested adding real notifications for the changelog. I apologise that this is not possible for this website as there are limitations imposed by the way the website was created which prevent such a feature from being implemented. Also note that the changelogs is something that is only editable by 3 people in total due to it being user-unfriendly for our team of editors, plus I have retired from making summaries, so you will no longer see many updates to the changelog (only for website changes and important additions). Thank you for your feedback; I have implemented quite a few suggestions from there into the website, and I massively appreciate your support. I wish you the best of luck in the new semester.<br><span class='text-muted'>- Jihad Al-Yahmadi</span>
