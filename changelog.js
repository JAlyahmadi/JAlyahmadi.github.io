{summary} Added P4 uro-reproductive system gross anatomy summary (lab session).
The alimentary system P1 summary is 2 pages long. First page contains well-labelled images of all specimens shown in the slides. Second page contains theoretical knowledge covering almost all the important questions given in the slides.
The uro-reproductive system P4 summary is 5 pages long. First two pages contain theoretical knowledge from the video recording on Moodle with diagrams. The second two pages contain the same labelled specimens from the slides (different slides showing different labels of the same specimen were merged into 1 for convenience). Last page shows a big diagram from the slides.
It is extremely recommended to study from those summaries; they are very high-yield. I still recommend going over the manual to see if there is anything important for you worth checking (I did not refer to the manual whilst making the summaries).
